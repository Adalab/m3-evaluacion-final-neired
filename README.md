## Rick and Morty - Final Assignment Neired
This project is the final assignament of Adalab's Module 3 in which we've been learning how to use the React library for JS in Single Page Applications (SPA) projects.
This project contains:
  - A main screen, or Home, with:
    路 a list of characters from the series 'Rick and Morty', showing an image, their name and species,
    路 a functional input, which can be used to filter the list by name in order to find a specific character,
    路 and the title (plus logo): 'Rick and Morty'.
  - A detail screen for each character with:
    路 an image, their name, species, if its dead, origin and number of episodes in which the character appears.
It has been programmed using (among others):
  - Prop-types for the definition of every prop type,
  - React Router for the creation and connection of the different screens (Home and Details),
  - Sass for styling, using Grid in the main screen,
  - Destructuring for code simplification in order to make it more readable.
  - Mobile first for responsive design.
